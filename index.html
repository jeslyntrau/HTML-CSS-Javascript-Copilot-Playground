    <i>This light, airy sponge cake is perfect for any occasion, filled with whipped cream and your favorite fresh fruits.</i>

    <p class="center-align"> Ah, summer nights at Grandma’s backyard—those memories are forever etched in my heart, like the smell of warm grass and the sound of cicadas humming in the distance. As the sun dipped behind the hills, we'd light up the bonfire and wait for the magic of the evening to unfold. There was always something special about those nights—s'mores crackling over the flames, the scent of BBQ in the air, and, of course, her famous whipped cream and fresh fruit cake. Oh, that cake!</p>

    <p class="center-align">Grandma’s cake wasn’t just a dessert; it was the sweet punctuation mark to every summer adventure. We’d spend the day running barefoot in the grass, collecting wildflowers, and building forts under the big oak tree. By dusk, our cheeks were sticky with popsicle residue, and fireflies began their twilight dance around us. But no matter how late it got, when Grandma carried that cake out to the picnic table, it felt like the real fun was just beginning.
        I remember the way the layers of sponge cake were always so perfectly light, like they could float right off the plate. Grandma had this way of folding the batter just so, making the cake impossibly fluffy but never dry. And that whipped cream—oh my! It was never too sweet, always just enough to leave you dreaming of clouds and summer kisses. She’d crown it with berries so fresh they still tasted of sunshine—strawberries, raspberries, and slices of kiwi fanned out like tiny emeralds glinting in the moonlight.</p>

    <p class="center-align">After the bonfire had burned down to embers, we’d sit around the patio with plates in our laps, digging into that cake by candlelight. I swear there was a kind of magic in every bite—the soft sponge, the cool whipped cream, the burst of juicy berries. It wasn’t just a dessert; it was happiness on a plate. And somehow, no matter how full we were from ribs and grilled corn, there was always room for a second slice (or a third... but who’s counting?).
        Sometimes, Grandma would let us "help" with the cake earlier in the day. That usually meant sneaking spoonfuls of whipped cream when her back was turned or eating half the fruit before it ever made it to the cake. She’d laugh and tell us, "A little taste test never hurt anyone." And she'd ruffle our hair with that sparkle in her eye that always made me feel like I was exactly where I was supposed to be
